Assignment: My Favourite Movies Blog

1. Introduction

This project is a personal blog that showcases a curated list of my favourite movies. I originally built this blog as an HTML-only assignment, and after learning CSS, I revisited it to improve its design, responsiveness, and interactivity using only HTML and CSS. The final website features a header, navigation bar, movie reviews (with posters, video trailers, and reviews), an "About Me" section, a "Contact" form, and a footer.

2. Objectives

Consistent Theme & Color Palette:
Implement a soothing, eye-friendly design with soft background colors and complementary text and accent colors.

Responsive Design:
Ensure the layout adapts well across devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile) using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries.

Clear Section Styling:
Distinct styling for the header, navigation, blog posts, about me, contact, and footer to improve readability and navigation.

Interactive Enhancements:
Add hover effects on images and navigation links to enrich user experience.

3. Code Structure and Design Decisions

3.1 HTML Structure

Header:
Displays the blog title and a short tagline with a gradient background for visual impact.

Navigation Bar:
Provides sticky links to key sections (Movie Reviews, About Me, and Contact) for easy access during scrolling.

Main Content:

Blog Posts (#blog):
Each movie review is encapsulated in a <section class="movie-container"> containing:
A movie title (<h2>)
A poster (<img>)
A video trailer (<iframe>)
A review (<p>)

About Me (#about):
A brief introduction styled with a distinct background.

Contact (#contact):
Contact details and a simple form for user messages.

Footer:
Displays copyright and designer information.

3.2 CSS Styling

General Styles:
A soft, neutral background reduces eye strain in low-light environments. The typography is chosen for clarity, with careful attention to font sizes and contrast.

Section-Specific Styles:

Header: Bold typography and generous padding set the tone.

Navigation: A dark background with hover effects on links improves usability.

Movie Containers: Card-like layouts with consistent sizing for images and videos (max-width of 600px) and subtle hover animations create a balanced, modern look.

About Me and Contact: Distinct background colors and ample padding highlight these sections.

Footer: A simple, matching design that ties the site together.

Responsive Design: Media queries adjust layout, font sizes, and spacing to ensure optimal viewing on various devices.

4. Meeting the Assignment Requirements

Overall Style:
A consistent, soothing color scheme and legible typography enhance the user experience.

Header & Navigation:
Clearly display the blog’s identity with an engaging header and accessible, interactive navigation.

Content Layout:
Movie reviews are cleanly separated into card layouts that maintain visual balance. The "About Me" and "Contact" sections provide necessary details with user-friendly formatting.

Responsiveness:
The design adapts well to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

5. Challenges and Solutions

Media Sizing:
Initial issues with mismatched video and image sizes were resolved by standardizing maximum widths and setting fixed or balanced heights for iframes.

Eye-Friendly Design:
Transitioning from a stark white background to a softer color palette improved visual comfort, especially in low-light conditions.

Navigation Accessibility:
Implementing a sticky navigation bar allowed users to easily access different sections even after scrolling.

6. Conclusion

This documentation outlines how the Favourite Movies Blog evolved from an HTML-only assignment into a fully styled, responsive website using HTML and CSS. The project reflects a thoughtful application of design principles—consistent theming, clear sectioning, responsive layouts, and interactive enhancements—to deliver a user-friendly and visually appealing blog.

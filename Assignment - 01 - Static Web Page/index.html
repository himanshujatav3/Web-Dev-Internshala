                    <p>Set during the last few months of World War II, Seita and his younger sister Setsuko had to find all possible ways to survive in a time where there was almost nothing already. <br>
                        From moments of heartwarming tenderness between brother and sister to the gut-wrenching despair of their circumstances, every scene is imbued with raw emotion. The bond between Seita and Setsuko is the beating heart of the film, a testament to the strength of family in the face of adversity.

                        The animation itself is a work of art, with every frame meticulously crafted to convey the mood and atmosphere of the story. The hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, composed by Michio Mamiya, further elevates the emotional impact, tugging at the heartstrings of the audience.

                    <p>Ten-year-old Chihiro and her parents end up at an abandoned amusement park inhabited by supernatural beings. Soon, she learns that she must work to free her parents who have been turned into pigs. <br>
                       The main character, Chihiro, is a brave, kind, and caring 10 year old girl.  Her mother and father take her to an abandoned amusement park. After both her parents are turned into pigs, Chihiro is lost in a spiritual world and she is helped by Haku, who gives her pills that keep her in human form.  The animation is amazing with Chihiro’s expressions and emotions. Spirited Away has won awards like Academy Award For Best Animated Features, Critic’s Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature, and the Golden Bear Award. All of the music in the movie is really smooth and calm to listen to. You should definitely listen to One Summer’s Day, Always With Me, and A Road To Somewhere.

                <h2>The Garden Of Words</h2>

                    <p>On a rainy morning in Tokyo, 15-year-old Takao, an aspiring shoemaker, decides to skip class to sketch designs in a beautiful garden. This is where he meets Yukari, a beautiful yet mysterious woman. They strike an unlikely friendship. <br>
                        The film has portrayed the character so well that it looks realistic. The beautiful garden, rain and love. The story revolves around two beautiful people and their separate life stories and how they end up falling for each other. 
                        I loved the rainy season theme. I think love can't be portrayed in any other more beautiful way than this. Love is not only to be with someone. Sometimes love triggers the most painful parts of our lives and yet we embrace it cuz we meet someone who teaches us to live with that pain happily. For me this movie have shown the exact thing.

                       Interstellar is a cinematic triumph that combines stunning visuals, a powerful score, and an emotionally charged story to create an unforgettable experience. It’s a film that speaks to both the heart and the mind, offering a journey that is as much about the exploration of space as it is about the exploration of human connections. Whether you’re a fan of science fiction or simply love great storytelling, Interstellar is a must-watch that will leave you inspired and in awe of the possibilities that lie beyond our world
